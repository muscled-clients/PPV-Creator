## Product and Scope Explanations

### 1. Research API (If Applying)

**How it works in our app:**

Our platform uses the Research API to fetch authentic view counts and engagement metrics for TikTok videos that influencers submit as part of their campaign deliverables. This data is crucial for:

- **Performance Tracking**: We track real view counts to calculate CPM (Cost Per Thousand views) payments for influencers
- **Campaign Analytics**: Brands can see actual performance metrics of sponsored content
- **ROI Measurement**: Accurate data helps brands measure campaign effectiveness
- **Fair Compensation**: Influencers are paid based on actual verified views, not estimates

**Specific Implementation:**
1. When an influencer submits a TikTok video URL for a campaign
2. Our system extracts the video ID and periodically queries the Research API
3. We store view counts, likes, comments, and shares in our database
4. This data is displayed in campaign dashboards for both brands and influencers
5. Payment calculations are based on verified view counts

**Data Usage:**
- We only access publicly posted videos that influencers explicitly submit
- Data is used solely for campaign performance tracking
- We do not scrape or access videos without explicit submission
- All data handling complies with TikTok's Terms of Service

### 2. Login Kit (If Applying)

**How it works in our app:**

The Login Kit allows influencers to authenticate their TikTok accounts, providing:

- **Account Verification**: Confirms the influencer owns the TikTok account they claim
- **Profile Import**: Automatically imports their TikTok username and basic profile info
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Reduces friction in the registration process
- **Trust Building**: Brands can verify influencer authenticity

**User Flow:**
1. Influencer clicks "Connect TikTok Account" during profile setup
2. They are redirected to TikTok's OAuth consent page
3. After authorization, we receive their basic profile information
4. Their TikTok handle is verified and linked to their platform account
5. This verification badge is shown to brands viewing their profile

### 3. Web SDK

**How it works in our app:**

We implement the TikTok Web SDK for:

- **Embedded Content**: Display TikTok videos directly in our campaign galleries
- **Preview Functionality**: Brands can preview submitted content without leaving our platform
- **Engagement Display**: Show real-time likes and comments on embedded videos

**Implementation Details:**
