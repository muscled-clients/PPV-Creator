# Withdrawal Feature - Delete Application

## New Behavior
When an influencer withdraws their application, the system now:

1. **DELETES the application from the database** completely
2. **DELETES all associated content links** from `application_content_links` table
3. **Allows re-application** to the same campaign immediately

## Benefits
- ✅ Influencers can re-apply if they change their mind
- ✅ No clutter of withdrawn applications in the database
- ✅ Cleaner application history
- ✅ Brand doesn't see withdrawn applications (they're gone)

## How It Works

### Withdrawal Process:
1. Influencer clicks "Withdraw Application"
2. Confirmation dialog: "This will delete your application and allow you to apply again if needed"
3. On confirmation:
   - Delete all content links for that application
   - Delete the application record
   - Show success message
   - Refresh the page

### Security Checks:
- Only the influencer who created the application can withdraw it
- Cannot withdraw approved applications (prevents accidental deletion of approved work)
- Pending and rejected applications can be withdrawn

## Code Changes Made

### 1. New Function: `withdrawApplication`
Located in: `lib/actions/application-actions-enhanced.ts`
```typescript
export async function withdrawApplication(applicationId: string) {
  // Verifies user ownership
  // Deletes content links first
  // Then deletes the application
  // Returns success message
}
```

### 2. Updated UI Component
Located in: `components/applications/application-card-enhanced.tsx`
- Uses `withdrawApplication` instead of status update
- Shows informative confirmation dialog
- Displays success toast message

### 3. Updated Manager Component
Located in: `components/applications/application-manager.tsx`
- Handles 'deleted' status by refreshing the page
- Removes the application from view immediately

## No Migration Needed
Since we're deleting applications instead of marking them as 'withdrawn', you DON'T need the status constraint migration anymore.

You still need to run the content links table migration if not done:
`supabase/migrations/20250121_add_multiple_content_links.sql`

## Testing the Feature

1. **As an Influencer:**
   - Apply to a campaign
   - Go to "My Applications"
   - Click "Withdraw Application" on a pending application
   - Confirm the withdrawal
   - Application disappears
   - Go back to the campaign - you can now apply again!

2. **As a Brand:**
   - Withdrawn applications won't appear in your dashboard
   - You won't receive notifications about withdrawals (applications just disappear)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want to track withdrawals for analytics:

1. **Add a withdrawal log table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE withdrawal_logs (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns(id),
  influencer_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  withdrawn_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  application_data JSONB -- Store the deleted application data
);
```

2. **Before deletion, log the withdrawal:**
```typescript
// In withdrawApplication function, before deleting:
await supabase
  .from('withdrawal_logs')
  .insert({
    campaign_id: application.campaign_id,
    influencer_id: application.influencer_id,
    application_data: application
  })
```

This way you can track withdrawal patterns without keeping the actual applications.
